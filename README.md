# Repeat Phrase Counter

This script lets you count literal repetition of words in a text.

## Usage
1) [Copy this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaniBodor/RepeatPhraseChecker/main/RepeatPhraseChecker.py) to a python editor or pull this repo from GitHub

2) Copy your text into Notepad (or similar) and save as a \*.txt file

3) In the first few lines input the correct parameters for:
    - filename: the name of the \*.txt file (or the full path if the file is in a different folder than this script)
    - phrase_length: the number of words in a row to check for
    - threshold_count: the minimum number of times that the phrase has to occur to be part of the output

4) Run the code

5) Open the resulting \*.csv file in Excel (or similar) and sort by column B
